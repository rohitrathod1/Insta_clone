# Insta_clone
A full-stack Instagram Clone built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack with Socket.io for real-time messaging. This project allows users to create accounts, post photos, like and comment on posts, follow/unfollow other users, and chat in real time â€” all with a modern responsive UI.
